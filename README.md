## Riddle
We have 5 persons. All of them have different hobbies, professions, vehicles, etc. 
The objective is to find the person who is the Merchant. But you have to follow this rules:

1. Who goes in a Motorbike is an Accountant
2. The person who arrives earlier than everybody uses a car.
3. Santiago arrives one hour later than the person who watches comedy.
4. Sonia arrives one hour and a half after the person who is a police.
5. The person who watches comedy is a professor.
6. The merchant goes to work after the person who goes in a car.
7. The person who goes in a van arrives one hour later than Juan.
8. Who arrives at 8.00 hs arrives at an average hour from everyone.
9. The person who watches movies arrives later than everybody.
10. The person who goes in a bicycle arrives 30 minutes after Sonia.
11. Who watches Soccer arrives at 8.30hs at work.
12. Who watches a soap opera arrives 1 hour earlier than Antonella.
13. Omar arrives at 7hs.
14. Who watches a series goes to work before the person who goes in a bus.
15. The person who is an engineer goes to work one hour after the person who is an Accountant.

This is a simple solution to understand how genetic algorithm works. Sometimes we can get to the answer and other times we can't. It depends on the hyper-parameters and the random initialization (and maybe some mistakes I have made or not hehe).

## Good luck!
